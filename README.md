Cafe Database Initial set up for docker and oracle 23c free database version of oracle

--- Introduction ----------

Oracle 23c Structure

Oracle Database 23c:

Instance: The instance is the set of memory structures and background processes that manage the database files.

Container Database (CDB):

CDB: The CDB includes the root container (CDB$ROOT) and one or more Pluggable Databases (PDBs).

Pluggable Database (PDB):

PDB: Acts as an independent database within the CDB. Each PDB has its own users, schemas, and objects. PDBs share the instanceâ€™s memory and processes but are otherwise isolated from one another.

Schema:

Schema: A logical grouping of database objects (tables, views, indexes, etc.) under a single user within a PDB. Each user owns their own schema and objects. So, within your Oracle 23c setup:

One instance manages one CDB.

The CDB contains multiple PDBs.

Each PDB is a self-contained database with its own schemas and objects.

Ubuntu Server 24.04.1 LTS for Database and docker for container.

==== Coder start here in Linux ========

-- Update server

sudo apt update

-- Install docker

sudo apt install docker.io

-- Create Volume for progress sudo docker volume create oracle_volume

-- Download oracle inside docker this about worth 10 Gb of

sudo docker run -itd --name Bookkeepeer -p 1521:1521 -e ORACLE_PWD='bookkeep123' -v oracle_volume:/opt/oracle/oradata container-registry.oracle.com/database/free:latest

-- Execute sql

sudo docker exec -it Bookkeepeer bash

-- make Directory for Pluggable and Script mkdir pluggable mkdir script mkdir backup

-- Login as admin -- For safer way sqlplus sys@locahost:1521 as sysdba sqlplus sys/1234@localhost:1521 as sysdba

-- PLUGGABLE DATABASE CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE Dev_Cafe admin user keeper IDENTIFIED BY Book create_file_dest='/home/oracle/plugbookkeep';

-- Set permision ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE Bookkeepeer OPEN; EXIT

-- Log in to the database -- For safer way sqlplus sys@localhost:1521/Dev_Cafe as sysdba sqlplus sys@localhost:1521/Bookkeepeer as sysdba

-- Grant access to Link 

GRANT DBA to Keeper

-- Production Access after the schema is created

CREATE ROLE prod_ROL;

BEGIN FOR t IN (SELECT table_name FROM all_tables WHERE owner = 'Dev_cafe') LOOP EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ' || 'Dev_cafe' || t.table_name || ' TO prod_ROLE'; END LOOP; END; /

CREATE USER Product IDENTIFIED BY Prod123!

GRANT prod_ROLE TO Product

EXIT

-- DBA As Keeper (user) 
-- safe way sqlplus Link@localhost:1521/Dev_Cafe sqlplus then provide the password

Keeper/Book@localhost:1521/Bookkeeper

-- or sqlplus 

Dev_Hyrule/dev_Password@localhost:1521/Bookkeeper

-- copy and paste the Bookkeeper.sql
